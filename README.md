## Detects and closes Numega Smart Check debugger \(all versions\), W32Dasm Deassembler & Hex Workshop


</div>

### Description

A very effective tool which detects and closes Numega Smart Check debugger tool (all versions), W32Dasm Deassembler or Hex Workshop. Just a few lines of code and very well commented.

Open any of the above programs first and then run this application. It detects the presence of these debuggers / deassemblers / hex editors and closes them. You can also raise an exception / system error on their detection (if you so desire).

For academic interest only, this program has also been extended to close any other application such as Notepad, Winamp etc.

Please vote and intimate me of any errors.
 
### More Info
 
None that I know of.
